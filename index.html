<p><i>"I had the privilege of meeting Jagatveer while we were hiring for a DevOps role at Lumiserv. We closed the position so I couldn't hire Jagatveer - so why this recommendation if we never worked together? I can tell you that he has a unique skill that is really valuable in tech... he thinks about things with an open and intelligent perspective. Not just how things affect him but the rest of the company, he thinks about how he communicates to different people (especially non-technical ones) and really cares about making a better company not just furthering his own interests. He's also really easy to get on with. Check out the article he wrote using part of our hiring process as the inspiration ... <a href="https://medium.com/@jagatveer/email-reply-an- opportunity-often-missed-b22957f9c63c#.7xbpe2a59">https://medium.com/@jagatveer/email-reply-an- opportunity-often-missed-b22957f9c63c#.7xbpe2a59 "</a></i></p>
